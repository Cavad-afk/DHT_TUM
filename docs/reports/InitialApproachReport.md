##Initial approach report 

1. _Indicate your team name, names of team members and, which sub-project you are working on._ 

`
Team name: Pickle Juice;
Team members: Emil Suleymanov (Me), Everything (DHT);
`

2. _Which programming language, operating system you want to use and the reasons for choosing them._

`Kotlin with maybe some Java (probably not). It’s null-safe, has coroutines, better syntax etc.
I’ll be aiming for Linux but should work on Windows as well.`

3. What type of build system is used.

`Gradle.`

4. _What measures do you intend to take to guarantee quality of your software._
 
  * _How do you write test cases for your software_
 
  `Following my intuition.`

  * _Quality control. For example: by using Valgrind, cppcheck, etc._ 
 
  `Never used anything for quality control so far. Should I?`

5. What libraries are already available to assist you in your project. 

`Anything you can find for Java.`

6. Which license do you intend to assign to your project’s software and reasons for doing so. 

`If it ends up being something useful for me, then probably GPL v3. If not, MIT (because I wouldn’t care).
`
7. Team members’ previous programming experience which is relevant to this project

`I’m an Android developer, and I don’t have much experience with networking. I’m taking GRNVS right now.
`
8. How do you plan to share the workload in your team

`100% me.`

9. Issues and complains

`Would be great to see deadlines in moodle.`
